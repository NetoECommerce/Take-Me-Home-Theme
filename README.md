# Take Me Home Theme

Take Me Home is one of Neto's free themes! 

## Installation

The safest way to install Take Me Home is through Neto's theme store. Go to **Content** > **Website Themes** in your Neto control panel, hover over _Take Me Home_ and click the green _Install_ button.

To install the latest version of Take Me Home directly from this repository you simply need to upload the `src` directory from this repository into the `httpdocs/assets/themes` directory on your website. You should also rename this new `src` directory to whatever you would like your custom theme to be named.

For the above, you will need FTP access to your Neto website, which you can request [here](http://docs.neto.com.au/designer-documentati/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-neto-via-ftp/).

## Documentation

Documentation for designers and developers can be found [here](https://www.neto.com.au/designer-documentation/).

As Take Me Home is built almost entirely upon Bootstrap 3, the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com) is perhaps the most valuable source of documentation for a web designer who isn't looking to build complex functionality.

## Compiling .less files

If you are not comfortable working with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), you are best off writing all CSS in your own custom CSS file. As our `.less` files are compiled into `app.css`, avoid modifying `app.css`. Otherwise, if for whatever reason you eventually do need to re-compile the less files, any changes to `app.css` would be lost.

If you are comfortable with Less, you're best off developing in you're own less file and adding it to the imports in ``src/css/app.less``, which needs to be compiled to ``src/css/app.css`` using Gulp. See our [Advanced Workflow documentation](https://www.neto.com.au/designer-documentation/developing-a-website-with-neto/advanced-development-workflow/), which helps you start from Take Me Home to build your own theme.

If you are compiling `.less` files for the purpose of contributing to Take Me Home, follow these steps:

_Note that steps 1 and 2 only need to be completed once per system, so no need to repeat them again._

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install Gulp globally with `npm install --global gulp` in your terminal, if you have not already
3. CD into your local folder for Take Me Home and run the `npm install` command to install all relevant dependencies
4. Run `gulp`â€”this will now watch your `.less` files and compile them as they change

## Testing

We have a simple testing guide located [here](/testing.md).

## Support

The current version of Take Me Home will only work on websites running Neto 6+. For older websites, you will need to install from a previous release.

## Creators

Take Me Home was created by the design team at [Neto E-commerce Solutions](http://neto.com.au).
